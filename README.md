Currently working as a DevOps Engineer @ Utrecht University. I like building software following good programming practices and I am most interested in Web Development, Computer Security, and Blockchain Technology.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer at [Navarino](https://navarino.co.uk/). Before that, I had also worked as a Software Engineer at the [Blockchain Technology Lab](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/blockchain) of the University of Edinburgh and [PLaST Lab](http://plast-lab.github.io/) of University of Athens.

I hold a [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2022&id=110) from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I also hold a [Bachelor's degree in Computer Science](https://www.di.uoa.gr/) from the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
