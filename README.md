Currently working as a Software Engineer in Athens, Greece. I like building software following good programming practices and I am most interested in Computer Security, Blockchain Technology and Web Application Development.

I hold a [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2022&id=110) from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I also hold a [Bachelor's degree in Computer Science](https://www.di.uoa.gr/) from the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
